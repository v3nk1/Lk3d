Creation/Applying a patch:
==========================
1. To a file:
-------------
	- Took a file in which you want to modify the things
		- modify means add/append/alter/delete line or character
	- Make a copy of the file to some name.
	- So that you are having 2 files,
		one is orignal file,
		2nd is to be modified file.

	- So do modification what ever you want in the second file.

	- Creation of patch:
		# diff -Naurp original modified > gen.patch
				file	 file

	- vi gen.patch
		See things about modifications.

	- Maitain the gen.patch in the same directory where original
	  file present.
	  Copy that 'gen.patch' to the orignal file directory 
		# patch < gen.patch

                        or

          Don't copy 'gen.patch' to the orignal directory
                # cd to <original-file-directory>
                # patch < /path/to/patch

	- Then original file has to be altered as per patch.

2. To a folder/directory/recursive patch:
-----------------------------------------
	- Took a directory in which you want to modify the things
	- Make a copy of the dir to some name.
	- So that you are having 2 dirs,
                one is orignal dir,
                2nd is to be modified dir.

	- So do modification in any file you want in the 2nd dir.

	- Creation of patch:
                # diff -Naurp original modified > gen.patch
                                dir      dir

        - vi gen.patch
                See things about modifications.

        - Copy that 'gen.patch' to the orignal directory
		# cd to <original-directory>  in which dir patch shud be applied.
                # patch -p1 < gen.patch

			or
	  Don't copy 'gen.patch' to the orignal directory
		# cd to <original-directory>
		# patch -p1 < /path/to/patch
		
	- Then all the changes will be applied to the original dir.
