          <h1>8.4. Const and volatile</h1>



  

  <p>These are new in Standard <a href="http://training.gbdirect.co.uk/courses/c/">C</a>, although the idea of <code>const</code>
   has been borrowed from <a href="http://training.gbdirect.co.uk/courses/c++/">C++</a>. Let us get one thing straight: the concepts
   of <code>const</code> and <code>volatile</code> are <em>completely
   independent</em>. A common misconception is to imagine that somehow
   <code>const</code> is the opposite of <code>volatile</code> and vice
   versa. They are unrelated and you should remember the fact.</p>

  <p>Since <code>const</code> declarations are the simpler, we'll look at
   them first, but only after we have seen where both of these type
   qualifiers may be used. The complete list of relevant keywords is</p>

<pre>char      long      float     volatile
short     signed    double    void
int       unsigned  const</pre>

  <p>In that list, <code>const</code> and <code>volatile</code> are type
   qualifiers, the rest are <dfn>type specifiers</dfn>. Various combinations
   of type specifiers are permitted:</p>

<pre>char, signed char, unsigned char
int, signed int, unsigned int
short int, signed short int, unsigned short int
long int, signed long int, unsigned long int
float
double
long double</pre>

  <p>A few points should be noted. All declarations to do with an
   <code>int</code> will be <code>signed</code> anyway, so signed is
   redundant in that context. If <em>any</em> other type specifier or
   qualifier is present, then the int part may be dropped, as that is the
   default.</p>

  <p>The keywords <code>const</code> and <code>volatile</code> can be
   applied to any declaration, including those of structures, unions,
   enumerated types or <code>typedef</code> names. Applying them to
   a declaration is called <dfn>qualifying</dfn> the declaration—that's
   why const and volatile are called type qualifiers, rather than type
   specifiers. Here are a few representative examples:</p>

<pre>volatile i;
volatile int j;
const long q;
const volatile unsigned long int rt_clk;
struct{
        const long int li;
        signed char sc;
}volatile vs;</pre>

  <p>Don't be put off; some of them are deliberately complicated: what they
   mean will be explained later. Remember that they could also be further
   complicated by introducing storage class specifications as well! In fact,
   the truly spectacular</p>

<pre>extern const volatile unsigned long int rt_clk;</pre>

  <p>is a strong possibility in some real-time operating system kernels.</p>

  <h2><a name="section-1"></a>8.4.1.&nbsp;Const</h2>
   

   <p>Let's look at what is meant when <code>const</code> is used. It's
    really quite simple: <code>const</code> means that something is not
    modifiable, so a data object that is declared with <code>const</code> as
    a part of its type specification must not be assigned to in any way
    during the run of a program. It is very likely that the definition of
    the object will contain an initializer (otherwise, since you can't
    assign to it, how would it ever get a value?), but this is not always
    the case. For example, if you were accessing a hardware port at a fixed
    memory address and promised only to read from it, then it would be
    declared to be <code>const</code> but not initialized.</p>

   <p>Taking the address of a data object of a type which isn't
    <code>const</code> and putting it into a pointer to the
    <code>const</code>-qualified version of the same type is both safe and
    explicitly permitted; you will be able to use the pointer to inspect the
    object, but not modify it. Putting the address of a const type into
    a pointer to the unqualified type is much more dangerous and
    consequently prohibited (although you can get around this by using
    a cast). Here is an example:</p>

<div class="inset-example"><a name="example-3"></a><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

main(){
        int i;
        const int ci = 123;

        /* declare a pointer to a const.. */
        const int *cpi;

        /* ordinary pointer to a non-const */
        int *ncpi;

        cpi = &amp;ci;
        ncpi = &amp;i;

        /*
         * this is allowed
         */
        cpi = ncpi;

        /*
         * this needs a cast
         * because it is usually a big mistake,
         * see what it permits below.
         */
        ncpi = (int *)cpi;

        /*
         * now to get undefined behaviour...
         * modify a const through a pointer
         */
        *ncpi = 0;

        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}</pre><cite>Example&nbsp;8.3</cite></div>

   <p>As the example shows, it is possible to take the address of a constant
    object, generate a pointer to a non-constant, then use the new pointer.
    This is an <em>error</em> in your program and results in undefined
    behaviour.</p>

   <p>The main intention of introducing const objects was to allow them to
    be put into read-only store, and to permit compilers to do extra
    consistency checking in a program. Unless you defeat the intent by doing
    naughty things with pointers, a compiler is able to check that
    <code>const</code> objects are not modified explicitly by the user.</p>

   <p>An interesting extra feature pops up now. What does this mean?</p>

<pre>char c;
char *const cp = &amp;c;</pre>

   <p>It's simple really; <code>cp</code> is a pointer to
    a <code>char</code>, which is exactly what it would be if the
    <code>const</code> weren't there. The <code>const</code> means that
    <code>cp</code> is not to be modified, although whatever it points to
    can be—the pointer is constant, not the thing that it points to.
    The other way round is</p>

<pre>const char *cp;</pre>

   <p>which means that now cp is an ordinary, modifiable pointer, but the
    thing that it points to must not be modified. So, depending on what you
    choose to do, both the pointer and the thing it points to may be
    modifiable or not; just choose the appropriate declaration.</p>

  

  <h2><a name="section-2"></a>8.4.2.&nbsp;Volatile</h2>
   

   <p>After const, we treat <code>volatile</code>. The reason for having
    this type qualifier is mainly to do with the problems that are
    encountered in real-time or embedded systems programming using C.
    Imagine that you are writing code that controls a hardware device by
    placing appropriate values in hardware registers at known absolute
    addresses.</p>

   <p>Let's imagine that the device has two registers, each 16 bits long, at
    ascending memory addresses; the first one is the control and status
    register (csr) and the second is a data port. The traditional way of
    accessing such a device is like this:</p>

<div class="inset-example"><a name="example-4"></a><pre>/* Standard C example but without const or volatile */
/*
* Declare the device registers
* Whether to use int or short
* is implementation dependent
*/

struct devregs{
        unsigned short  csr;    /* control &amp; status */
        unsigned short  data;   /* data port */
};

/* bit patterns in the csr */
#define ERROR   0x1
#define READY   0x2
#define RESET   0x4

/* absolute address of the device */
#define DEVADDR ((struct devregs *)0xffff0004)

/* number of such devices in system */
#define NDEVS   4

/*
* Busy-wait function to read a byte from device n.
* check range of device number.
* Wait until READY or ERROR
* if no error, read byte, return it
* otherwise reset error, return 0xffff
*/
unsigned int read_dev(unsigned devno){

        struct devregs *dvp = DEVADDR + devno;

        if(devno &gt;= NDEVS)
                return(0xffff);

        while((dvp-&gt;csr &amp; (READY | ERROR)) == 0)
                ; /* NULL - wait till done */

        if(dvp-&gt;csr &amp; ERROR){
                dvp-&gt;csr = RESET;
                return(0xffff);
        }

        return((dvp-&gt;data) &amp; 0xff);
}</pre><cite>Example&nbsp;8.4</cite></div>

   <p>The technique of using a structure declaration to describe the device
    register layout and names is very common practice. Notice that there
    aren't actually any objects of that type defined, so the declaration
    simply indicates the structure without using up any store.</p>

   <p>To access the device registers, an appropriately cast constant is used
    as if it were pointing to such a structure, but of course it points to
    memory addresses instead.</p>

   <p>However, a major problem with previous C compilers would be in the
    while loop which tests the status register and waits for the
    <code>ERROR</code> or <code>READY</code> bit to come on. Any
    self-respecting optimizing compiler would notice that the loop tests the
    same memory address over and over again. It would almost certainly
    arrange to reference memory once only, and copy the value into
    a hardware register, thus speeding up the loop. This is, of course,
    exactly what we don't want; this is one of the few places where we must
    look at the place where the pointer points, every time around the
    loop.</p>

   <p>Because of this problem, most C compilers have been unable to make
    that sort of optimization in the past. To remove the problem (and other
    similar ones to do with when to write to where a pointer points), the
    keyword <code>volatile</code> was introduced. It tells the compiler that
    the object is subject to sudden change for reasons which cannot be
    predicted from a study of the program itself, and forces every reference
    to such an object to be a genuine reference.</p>

   <p>Here is how you would rewrite the example, making use of
    <code>const</code> and <code>volatile</code> to get what you want.</p>

<div class="inset-example"><a name="example-5"></a><pre>/*
* Declare the device registers
* Whether to use int or short
* is implementation dependent
*/

struct devregs{
        unsigned short volatile csr;
        unsigned short const volatile data;
};

/* bit patterns in the csr */
#define ERROR   0x1
#define READY   0x2
#define RESET   0x4

/* absolute address of the device */
#define DEVADDR ((struct devregs *)0xffff0004)

/* number of such devices in system */
#define NDEVS   4

/*
* Busy-wait function to read a byte from device n.
* check range of device number.
* Wait until READY or ERROR
* if no error, read byte, return it
* otherwise reset error, return 0xffff
*/
unsigned int read_dev(unsigned devno){

        struct devregs * const dvp = DEVADDR + devno;

        if(devno &gt;= NDEVS)
                return(0xffff);

        while((dvp-&gt;csr &amp; (READY | ERROR)) == 0)
                ; /* NULL - wait till done */

        if(dvp-&gt;csr &amp; ERROR){
                dvp-&gt;csr = RESET;
                return(0xffff);
        }

        return((dvp-&gt;data) &amp; 0xff);
}</pre><cite>Example&nbsp;8.5</cite></div>

   <p>The rules about mixing <code>volatile</code> and regular types
    resemble those for <code>const</code>. A pointer to
    a <code>volatile</code> object can be assigned the address of a regular
    object with safety, but it is dangerous (and needs a cast) to take the
    address of a <code>volatile</code> object and put it into a pointer to
    a regular object. Using such a derived pointer results in undefined
    behaviour.</p>

   <p>If an array, union or structure is declared with <code>const</code> or
    <code>volatile</code> attributes, then all of the members take on that
    attribute too. This makes sense when you think about it—how could
    a member of a <code>const</code> structure be modifiable?</p>

   <p>That means that an alternative rewrite of the last example would be
    possible. Instead of declaring the device registers to be
    <code>volatile</code> in the structure, the pointer could have been
    declared to point to a <code>volatile</code> structure instead, like
    this:</p>

<pre>struct devregs{
      unsigned short  csr;    /* control &amp; status */
      unsigned short  data;   /* data port */
};
volatile struct devregs *const dvp=DEVADDR+devno;</pre>

   <p>Since <code>dvp</code> points to a <code>volatile</code> object, it
    not permitted to optimize references through the pointer. Our feeling is
    that, although this would work, it is bad style. The
    <code>volatile</code> declaration belongs in the structure: it is the
    device registers which are <code>volatile</code> and that is where the
    information should be kept; it reinforces the fact for a human
    reader.</p>

   <p>So, for any object likely to be subject to modification either by
    hardware or asynchronous interrupt service routines, the volatile type
    qualifier is important.</p>

   <p>Now, just when you thought that you understood all that, here comes
    the final twist. A declaration like this:</p>

<pre>volatile struct devregs{
      /* stuff */
}v_decl;</pre>

   <p>declares the type <code>struct devregs</code> and also
    a <code>volatile</code>-qualified object of that type, called
    <code>v_decl</code>. A later declaration like this</p>

<pre>struct devregs nv_decl;</pre>

   <p>declares <code>nv_decl</code> which is <em>not</em> qualified with
    <code>volatile</code>! The qualification is <em>not</em> part of the
    type of <code>struct devregs</code> but applies only to the declaration
    of <code>v_decl</code>. Look at it this way round, which perhaps makes
    the situation more clear (the two declarations are the same in their
    effect):</p>

<pre>struct devregs{
      /* stuff */
}volatile v_decl;</pre>

   <p>If you do want to get a shorthand way of attaching a qualifier to
    another type, you can use <code>typedef</code> to do it:</p>

<pre>struct x{
      int a;
};
typedef const struct x csx;

csx const_sx;
struct x non_const_sx = {1};

const_sx = non_const_sx;        /* error - attempt to modify a const */</pre>

   <h3><a name="section-2.1"></a>8.4.2.1.&nbsp;Indivisible Operations</h3>
    

    <p>Those of you who are familiar with techniques that involve hardware
     interrupts and other ‘real time’ aspects of programming will
     recognise the need for <code>volatile</code> types. Related to this
     area is the need to ensure that accesses to data objects are
     ‘atomic’, or uninterruptable. To discuss this is any depth would
     take us beyond the scope of this book, but we can at least outline some
     of the issues.</p>

    <p>Be careful not to assume that any operations written in C are
     uninterruptable. For example,</p>

<pre>extern const volatile unsigned long realtimeclock;</pre>

    <p>could be a counter which is updated by a clock interrupt routine. It
     is essential to make it <code>volatile</code> because of the
     asynchronous updates to it, and it is marked <code>const</code> because
     it should not be changed by anything other than the interrupt routine.
     If the program accesses it like this:</p>

<pre>unsigned long int time_of_day;

time_of_day = real_time_clock;</pre>

    <p>there may be a problem. What if, to copy one <code>long</code> into
     another, it takes several machine instructions to copy the two words
     making up <code>real_time_clock</code> and <code>time_of_day</code>? It
     is possible that an interrupt will occur in the middle of the
     assignment and that in the worst case, when the low-order word of
     <code>real_time_clock</code> is <code>0xffff</code> and the high-order
     word is <code>0x0000</code>, then the low-order word of
     <code>time_of_day</code> will receive <code>0xffff</code>. The
     interrupt arrives and increments the low-order word of
     <code>real_time_clock</code> to <code>0x0</code> and then the
     high-order word to <code>0x1</code>, then returns. The rest of the
     assignment then completes, with <code>time_of_day</code> ending up
     containing <code>0x0001ffff</code> and <code>real_time_clock</code>
     containing the correct value, <code>0x00010000</code>.</p>

    <p>This whole class of problem is what is known as a critical region,
     and is well understood by those who regularly work in asynchronous
     environments. It should be understood that Standard C takes no special
     precautions to avoid these problems, and that the usual techniques
     should be employed.</p>

    <p>The header <code>‘signal.h’</code> declares a type called
     <code>sig_atomic_t</code> which is guaranteed to be modifiable safely
     in the presence of asynchronous events. This means only that it can be
     modified by assigning a value to it; incrementing or decrementing it,
     or anything else which produces a new value depending on its previous
     value, is not safe.</p>
