     <h2>Do You Volatile? Should You?</h2>
     <p>
     </p><div style="font-style:italic; font-size:10pt;">By Kevin P. Dankwardt, Ph.D.</div>
     <p>
     <em>Volatile</em> is an ANSI C type modifier that is frequently 
needed in C code that is part of signal/interrupt handlers, threaded 
code, and other kernel code, including device drivers. In general, any 
data that may be undated asynchronously should be declared to be 
volatile. Incidentally, this issue is not related to CPU caches except 
that re-loading of variables into registers may involve cache hits or 
misses.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Use Volatile?</h3> 
    <p>
    The reason to use volatile is to insure that the compiler generates 
code to re-load a data item each time it is referenced in your program. 
Without volatile, the compiler may generate code that merely re-uses the
 value it already loaded into a register.
    </p><p>
Volatile advises the compiler that the data may be modified in a manner 
that may not be determinable by the compiler. This could be, for 
example, when a pointer is mapped to a device's hardware registers. The 
device may independently change the values unbeknownst to the compiler.
    </p><p></p>With <em>gcc</em> the <em>-O2</em> option is normally required to see the effect of not using volatile. Without <em>-O2</em> or greater optimization, the compiler is likely to re-load registers each time a variable is referenced, anyway. 
    Don't blame the optimizer if a program gets incorrect results because the program does not use volatile where required.
    <p></p><p>
    For example, if two threads share a variable, <em>sum</em>, and one 
or both threads modify it, then the other thread may use a stale value 
in a register instead of going back to memory to get the new value. 
Instead, each time the thread references sum, it must be re-loaded. The 
way to insure this occurs in ANSI C is to declare sum to be volatile.
    </p>
    <h3>Example 1.</h3> 
    <p> The use of volatile can be required to get correct answers. For example the program <a class="underit" href="http://www.kcomputing.com/wrong.html">wrong</a> will give incorrect results when it is compiled <em>-O2</em> and without <em>volatile</em>.
 
    This slightly obtuse program is designed to stop after 100 ticks of 
an interval timer that ticks at 100Hz  and print the value of the 
variable <em>total</em>. The tick count is incremented in the signal 
handler. When the count gets to 100, the program should terminate. If 
the tick count does not get to 100 within 10 seconds then an alarm goes 
off and the program terminates.
    </p><p>By compiling the program as: 
<span style="text-style:courier">gcc -O2 -DVOLATILE=volatile wrong.c -o wrong_v</span>
 
you will see, (unless your program is preempted for quite a while), that
 the count gets to 100 and the program terminates as designed. 
With the program compiled as 
<span style="text-style:courier">gcc -O2 wrong.c -o wrong_nv</span> 
you will see, that the count becomes greater than 100  as shown when the
 handler prints it, but, the while loop does not terminate.
   </p><p>Incidentally, attempts to determine what is happening may 
thwart your efforts. For example, a function call, such as to printf(), 
or the use of a breakpoint, in the loop, will likely spill and re-load 
the registers.  </p>
    <h3>Syntax</h3> 
    <p>
    The keyword volatile is  similar to the <em>const</em> keyword. 
Volatile is used to modify a type. Thus an int, const int, pointer, etc.
 may be declared to be volatile. In addition, a point may be declared to
 be a <em>pointer to volatile</em>. A pointer to volatile means that the
 data to which the pointer refers is volatile as opposed to the pointer 
itself. Of course, both the pointer and to which it refers, may be 
declared to be volatile. 
    </p><p> To declare a volatile int do: 
    </p><p><span style="font-family:courier">volatile int v; </span></p><p> and to declare vp to be a pointer to a volatile int do:
    </p><p><span style="font-family:courier">volatile int *vp; </span></p>
    <p> Since deciphering C declarations can be difficult you may want to consult the <a href="http://www.sun.com/971124/cover-linden/cchap.html">C declaration chapter</a> in the Sun manual. This manual references the <a class="underit" href="http://www.sun.com/971124/cover-linden/decoder.gif">Decoder Flowchart</a> that can be used to help decipher declarations. 
</p><p>In addition, Linux may have the <em>cdecl(1)</em> program that can be used to translate C declarations to English, as for example, in 
    </p><p><span style="font-family:courier">echo 'explain volatile int *v' | cdecl</span></p>
    <p>
 which will answer with 
    </p><p><span style="font-family:courier">
declare v as a pointer to volatile int
</span></p>
    <p>
    Reading C declarations is made simpler when you realize that they are written 
    <a class="underit" href="http://developer.syndetic.org/query_jargon.pl?term=boustrophedonically">boustrophedonically</a>. Of course, even knowing the definition of <em>boustrophedonically</em>
 doesn't really help. The idea is that C declarations are interpreted 
based on the tricky precedence of operators such as "*", "[]", and "()".
 
    </p><p>
    </p><h3>Performance Issues</h3> 
    In some sense, <em>volatile</em> is the opposite of <em>register</em>. Thus, one can expect to lose performance. This means don't use volatile when it is not needed. 
    <h3>Example 2.</h3> 
    <p>
    In our <a class="underit" href="http://www.kcomputing.com/perf.html">performance</a> example we can see the difference that <em>volatile</em> may make. If we compile this program with and without <em>VOLATILE</em> defined as <em>volatile</em>
    we see an average number of iterations of almost 5,000 for the <em>volatile</em> case and almost 20,000 for the <em>non-volatile</em> case. Yikes! Remember that we must compile both of them with the <em>-O2</em> option. (These iteration counts were made on a 400Mhz AMD-K6.)
    </p><p>
    </p><h3>Linux Examples</h3>
    The use of the <em>volatile</em> keyword is common in the Linux kernel source. For example, of the 10,607 <em>.c</em> and <em>.h</em> files in the Fedora Core 1, Linux kernel source directory, 1,694 have the string "volatile" in them somewhere. As an example, 
the file 
<span style-"font-family:courier"="">drivers/net/eepro.c</span> uses <em>volatile</em> in three places.
<p>
</p><div style="font-family:courier">
385:	volatile s32 cmd_status;	/* All command and status fields. */<br>
392:	volatile s32 status;<br>
764:		volatile s32 *self_test_results;<br>
</div><p></p><p>

    </p><h3>Generated Code</h3>
    By examining the code generated by the compiler one can see the difference <em>volatile</em> makes. 
    In this 
<a class="underit" href="http://www.kcomputing.com/simple.html">simple</a> 
example we can see the x86 assembly language when volatile 
<a class="underit" href="http://www.kcomputing.com/simple-s-vol.html">is</a> used and when volatile is 
<a class="underit" href="http://www.kcomputing.com/simple-s-not.html">not</a> used.

    <h3>Summary</h3> 
    <p>
    The <em>volatile</em> keyword is relatively unknown. There are times
 when its use is required for correct operation of C/C++ programs. In 
general, whenever a variable may be altered asynchronously, such as by a
 signal handler or mapped hardware, the variable must be declared to be 
volatile. 
    </p><p> 
    Since volatile prevents re-using values in registers, volatile comes with a performance penalty that can be substantial. 
</p><p>Also, since declarations involving <em>volatile</em> can be difficult to decipher you may want to use cdecl(1).
