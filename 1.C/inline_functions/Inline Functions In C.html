  <h1>Inline Functions In C</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>GNU C (and some other compilers) had inline functions long before standard
  C introduced them (in the 1999 standard); this page summarizes the rules they
  use, and makes some suggestions as to how to actually use inline
  functions.</p>

  <p>The point of making a function <tt>inline</tt> is to hint to the compiler that it
  is worth making some form of extra effort to call the function faster than it
  would otherwise - generally by substituting the code of the function into its
  caller.  As well as eliminating the need for a call and return sequence, it
  might allow the compiler to perform certain optimizations between the bodies of
  both functions. </p>

  <p>Sometimes it is necessary for the compiler to emit a stand-alone copy of
  the object code for a function even though it is an inline function - for
  instance if it is necessary to take the address of the function, or if it
  can't be inlined in some particular context, or (perhaps) if optimization has
  been turned off.  (And of course, if you use a compiler that doesn't
  understand <tt>inline</tt>, you'll need a stand-alone copy of the object code so that
  all the calls actually work at all.)</p>

  <p>There are various ways to define inline functions; any given kind of
  definition might definitely emit stand-alone object code, definitely not emit
  stand-alone object code, or only emit stand-alone object code if it is
  known to be needed.  Sometimes this can lead to duplication of object code,
  which is a potential problem for following reasons:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>It wastes space.</li>

   <li>It can cause pointers to what is apparently the same function to compare
   not equal to one another.</li>

   <li>It might reduce the effectiveness of the instruction cache.  (Although
   inlining might do that in other ways too.)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If any of these are a problem for you then you will want to use a strategy
  that avoids duplication.  These are discussed below.</p>

  <h2>C99 inline rules</h2>

  <p>The specification for <tt>inline</tt> is section 6.7.4 of
  the C99 standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1999).  Unfortunately this isn't
  freely available.  The following possibilities exist:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>
    <p>A function where all the declarations (including the definition) mention
    <tt>inline</tt> and never <tt>extern</tt>.  There must be a
    definition in the same translation unit.  The standard refers to
    this as an <i>inline definition</i>.  No stand-alone object code
    is emitted, so this definition can't be called from another
    translation unit.</p>

    <p>You can<sup>1</sup> have a separate (not inline) definition in
    another translation unit, and the compiler might choose either
    that or the inline definition.</p>

    <p>Such functions may not contain modifiable static variables, and may not
    refer to static variables or functions elsewhere in the source file where
    they are declared.</p>

    <p>In this example, all the declarations and definitions
    use <tt>inline</tt> but not <tt>extern</tt>:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">// <i>a declaration mentioning inline</i>
inline int max(int a, int b);

// <i>a definition mentioning inline</i>
inline int max(int a, int b) {
  return a &gt; b ? a : b;
}</pre>

    <p>The function won't be callable from other files; if another
    file has a definition that might be used instead.</p>

    <p style="margin-left:2em"><sup>1</sup> The standard is vague on
    this point.  It says that the inline definition <i>does not
    forbid</i> an external definition elsewhere, but then that
    it <i>provides an alternative to an external definition</i>.
    Unfortunately this doesn't really make clear whether this external
    definition must actually exist.</p>

    <p style="margin-left:2em">In practice unless you are
    torture-testing your compiler it will exist: if you wanted to keep
    your inline function entirely private to one translation unit, you
    make it <tt>static inline</tt>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>
    <p>A function where at least one declaration
    mentions <tt>inline</tt>, but where some declaration doesn't
    mention <tt>inline</tt> or does mention <tt>extern</tt>.  There
    must be a definition in the same translation unit.  Stand-alone
    object code is emitted (just like a normal function) and can be
    called from other translation units in your program.</p>

    <p>The same constraint about statics above applies here, too.</p>

    <p>In this example all the declarations and definitions
    use <tt>inline</tt> but one adds <tt>extern</tt>:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">// <i>a declaration mentioning extern and inline</i>
extern inline int max(int a, int b);

// <i>a definition mentioning inline</i>
inline int max(int a, int b) {
  return a &gt; b ? a : b;
}</pre>

    <p>In this example, one of the declarations does not
    mention <tt>inline</tt>:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">// <i>a declaration not mentioning inline</i>
int max(int a, int b);

// <i>a definition mentioning inline</i>
inline int max(int a, int b) {
  return a &gt; b ? a : b;
}</pre>

    <p>In either example, the function <i>will</i> be callable from
    other files.</p>

   </li>

   <li>
     <p>A function defined <tt>static inline</tt>.  A local definition
     may be emitted if required.  You can have multiple definitions in
     your program, in different translation units, and it will still
     work.  Just dropping the <tt>inline</tt> reduces the program to a
     portable one (again, all other things being equal).</p>

     <p>This is probably useful primarily for small functions that you
     might otherwise use macros for.  If the function isn't always
     inlined then you get duplicate copies of the object code, with
     the problems described above.</p>

     <p>A sensible approach would be to put the <tt>static inline</tt>
     functions in either a header file if they are to be widely used
     or just in the source files that use them if they are only ever
     used from one file.</p>

     <p>In this example the function is defined <tt>static inline</tt>:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">// <i>a definition using static inline</i>
static inline int max(int a, int b) {
  return a &gt; b ? a : b;
}</pre>

   </li>

  </ul>

  <p>The first two possibilities go together naturally.  You either
  write <tt>inline</tt> everywhere and <tt>extern</tt> in one place to
  request a stand-alone definition, or write <tt>inline</tt> almost
  everywhere but omit it exactly once to get the stand-alone
  definition.</p>

  <p><tt>main</tt> is not allowed to be an inline function.</p>

  <p>(If you think I've misinterpreted these rules, please let me know!)</p>

  <p>(C++ is stricter: a function which is inline anywhere must be inline
  everywhere and must be defined identically in all the translation units that
  use it.)</p>

  <h2>GNU C inline rules</h2>

  <p>The GNU C rules are described in the GNU C manual, which is included with
  the compiler.  This is freely available if you follow links from e.g. <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">http://gcc.gnu.org</a>.  The following 
  possibilities exist:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>
    <p>A function defined with <tt>inline</tt> on its own.  Stand-alone object code is
    always emitted.  You can only write one definition like this in your entire
    program.  If you want to use it from other translation units to the one
    where it is defined, you put a declaration in a header file; but it would
    not be inlined in those translation units.</p>

    <p>This is of rather limited use: if you only want to use the function from
    one translation unit then <tt>static inline</tt> below makes more sense, if not the
    you probably want some form that allows the function to be inlined in more
    than one translation unit.</p>

    <p>However it does have the advantage that by defining away the <tt>inline</tt>
    keyword, the program reduces to a portable program with the same meaning
    (provided no other non-portable constructions are used).</p>

   </li>

   <li>
    <p>A function defined with <tt>extern inline</tt>.  Stand-alone object code is
    never emitted.  You can have multiple such definitions and your program will
    still work.  However, you should add a non-inline definition somewhere too,
    in case the function is not inlined everywhere.</p>

    <p>This provides sensible semantics (you can avoid duplicate copies of the
    functions' object code) but is a bit inconvenient to use.</p>
 
    <p>One approach to using this would be to put the definitions in a header
    file, surrounded by a #if that expands to true either when using GNU C, or
    when the header has been included from the file that is contain the emitted
    definitions (whether or not using GNU C).  In the latter case the <tt>extern</tt>
    is omitted (for instance writing <tt>EXTERN</tt> and #define-ing that to either
    <tt>extern</tt> or nothing).  The <tt>#else</tt> branch would contain just declarations of
    the functions, for non-GNU compilers.</p>

   </li>

   <li>
    <p>A function defined with <tt>static inline</tt>.  Stand-alone
    object code may be emitted if required.  You can have multiple
    definitions in your program, in different translation units, and
    it will still work.  This is the same as the C99 rules.
   </p></li>

  </ul>

  <p>As of release 4.3, GNU C supports the C99 inline rules described
  above and defaults to them with the <tt>-std=c99</tt>
  or <tt>-std=gnu99</tt> options.  The old rules can be requested in
  new compilers with the <tt>-gnu89-inline</tt> option or via
  the <tt>gnu_inline</tt> function attribute.</p>

  <p>If the C99 rules are in force then GCC will define
  the <tt>__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__</tt> macro.  Since GCC 4.1.3, it will
  define <tt>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</tt> if the GCC-only rules are in
  use, but older compilers use these rules without defining either
  macro.  You could normalize the situation with a fragment like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:1em">#if defined __GNUC__ &amp;&amp; !defined __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__ &amp;&amp; !defined __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__
# define __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ 1
#endif</pre>

  <h2>Strategies for using inline functions</h2>

  <p>These rules suggest several possible models for using inline functions in
  more or less portable ways.</p>

  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>A simple portable model.  Use <tt>static inline</tt> (either in a common header
    file or just in one file).  If the compiler needs to emit a definition
    (e.g. to take its address, or because it doesn't want to inline some call)
    then you waste a bit of space; if you take the address of the function in
    two translation units then the result won't compare equal.</p>

    <p>For instance, in a header file:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">static inline int max(int a, int b) {
  return a &gt; b ? a : b;
}</pre>

    <p>You can support legacy compilers (i.e. anything without <tt>inline</tt>) via
    <span class="option">-Dinline=""</span>, although this may waste
    space if the compiler does not optimize out unused functions..</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>A GNU C model.  Use <tt>extern inline</tt> in a common header and provide a
    definition in a .c file somewhere, perhaps using macros to ensure that the
    same code is used in each case.  For instance, in the header file:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">#ifndef INLINE
# define INLINE extern inline
#endif
INLINE int max(int a, int b) {
  return a &gt; b ? a : b;
}
</pre>

    <p>...and in exactly one source file:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">#define INLINE
#include "header.h"</pre>

    <p>Supporting legacy compilers is awkward unless you don't mind wasting
    space and having multiple addresses for the same function; you need to
    restrict the definitions to a in single translation unit (with INLINE
    defined to the empty string) and add some external declarations in the
    header file.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>A C99 model.  Use <tt>inline</tt> in a common header, and provide definitions
   in a .c file somewhere, via <tt>extern</tt> declarations.  For instance, in the
   header file:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">inline int max(int a, int b) {
  return a &gt; b ? a : b;
}</pre>

    <p>...and in exactly one source file:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">#include "header.h"
extern int max(int a, int b);</pre>

    <p>To support legacy compilers, you have to swap the whole thing around so
    that the declarations are visible in the common header and the definitions
    are restricted to a single translation unit, with inline defined away.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>A complicated portable model.  Use macros to choose either <tt>extern
   inline</tt> for GNU C, <tt>inline</tt> for C99, or neither for a definition.  For
   instance, in the header:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">#ifndef INLINE
# if __GNUC__ &amp;&amp; !__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__
#  define INLINE extern inline
# else
#  define INLINE inline
# endif
#endif
INLINE int max(int a, int b) {
  return a &gt; b ? a : b;
}
</pre>

    <p>...and in exactly one source file:</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:1em">#define INLINE
#include "header.h"</pre>

    <p>Supporting legacy compilers has the same issues as the GNU C model.</p>

   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please report any errors.</p>
