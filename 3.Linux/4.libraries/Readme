_init, _fini are for only dynamic libraries(shared object)
not for static libraries

DYNAMIC LIB:
------------
	Dynamic library can be created using more than one .o
	So, if .so is being created with more than one .o then
	ensure that there is only one instance of _init, _fini.
	
	Each dynamic library should have a single instance of _init,
	_fini.

STATIC LIB:
-----------
	Static Libraries are lil confusing. Bcoz there is a mis-coneception
	that static libraries will integrate into the exectutable being 
	created despite of function being called in the executable if 
	compile time linking been used. 

	But in objdump -D a.out, 
	it clearly shows that which function is being 
	called in source(main) file that only will be integrated by linker.

HEADER FILE IMPORTANCE:
-----------------------

	For only validation and sanity checks that should be done 
	before calling a function, Otherwise it doesn't mind 
	about type, count, return type of the formal arguments of 
	function.
