Each process is associated with 3 standard descriptors.
Those are
	standard input |		stdin	fd=0
	standard output|		stdout	fd=1
	standard error |		stderr	fd=2


1) stdin is ment for taking input from console, using scanf(),getchar()
   fread(),read().
   without this '0' descriptor above functions will not work. bcoz those
   are deadly dependent on stdin.

	close(0);
	getchar();		/* It wont block/seek for input*/
	scanf("%d",&a);		/* It wont block/seek for input*/

2) stdout is ment for printing output to console, using printf(),putchar(),
   fwrite(),write() calls.
   without this '1' descriptor above functions will not work. bcoz those
   are deadly dependent on stdout. without stdout to where those print 
   information.

	close(1);
	putchar('h');		/* It wont print to output*/
	printf("%d",a);		/* It wont print to output*/

3) stderr is ment for printing error msg to console, using perror(),ferror()..
   without this '2' descriptor above functions will not work.
   Those fuctions neither fail nor print any thing.

	close(2);
	open("non_exist_file",O_RDWR);
	perror("open");		/* It wont print to error console*/

   error console is internally connect/redirect to stdout.
