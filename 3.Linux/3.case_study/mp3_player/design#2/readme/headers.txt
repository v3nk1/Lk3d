	In this headers.h file there is one global structure., this is only one way to use structure in other linking file.
	this headers.h is must included in that particular linking file where the stucture is used.
	
	The defined structure in headers.h is full of fuction_pointers. becoz we are storing individual function address in their respective func_pointers, so that we can call approriate one with respect to plugin. since all plugin s  must call same fuctions.

   =>   OR there is no other way actually, if u are irritated by including headers.h then difine structures where u required., no      extern keyword is valid with structures remember.
	
	and typedef is generally used for simplicity to declare very simply ie., by typedef no need to write "stuct tag_name" instead one assigned Identifier can be used.. 

	Declare each plugins(ie., mp3,mp4 ..) by extern in headers.h only, bcoz we define structure in headers.h na??
