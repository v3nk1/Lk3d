	Declare an array of pointers to struct to store handlers at runtime.. say 10. so sh *handlers[10];
this 10 is the limitation in design#3;

	create a function reg_handler() it catches a pointer to structure as of now gifHandler.c sends its registration address in d function _init();
	then we assigned catched object address to handlers[0],and next is assigned to handlers[1] and so-on with d help of integer variable declared globally. and increments it for every assignment.
