Design 3: 
`````````
	  Here we are creating shared objects and loading them dynamically;
	  In dynamical loading libraries 2 types are there 1.load time lib  2. runtime lib.
	
    Here all are same same as design#2 except that here we are loading imageHandlers as shared objects by dynamically at runtime;

    Here for loading the Handlers we invoking  one fucntion vloadHandlers in main(), which is defined in viml layer.
    we are invoking it as first step of main() function becoz before user request we must load the handlers to identy user is asking a valid formate or not..


	And here dlclose(); is not madidatory it automatically unregistered at the end of program., ie., at the end of the program automatically _fini() exectutes na??
