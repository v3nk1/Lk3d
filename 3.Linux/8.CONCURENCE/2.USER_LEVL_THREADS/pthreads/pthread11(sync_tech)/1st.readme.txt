ALL SUB FOLDERS THE SCENARIO IS ONLY ONE: THAT IS ACCESSING A GLOBAL DATA SYNCHRONIZELY..
	HERE CASESS 2 THREADS ARE TRY TO ACCESS THE GLOBAL DATA..
	ALL THESE SCENARIOS WILL BE USEFULL TO U WHEN U SHARE A GLOBAL RESOURCE(DATA) BETWEEN TWO THREAD, IN SUCH CASES SYNCHRONIZATION IS SO BADLY REQUIRED.. TO ACHIEVE SYNCHRONIZATION WE USE LOCKING MECHANISMS..
