HERE OPEN TWO TABS:
	IN FIRST TAB RUN ./SIGNAL3 EXECUTABLE CREATED BY COMPILING AS "cc ./signal3.c -o ./signal3"
	ANOTHER TAB RUN ./KILL EXECUTABE CREATED BY COMPILING AS "cc ./kill.c -o ./kill" .. by this we are sending all signals to the signal3.c process. by editing pid(1st argument) in man 2 kill function our current running signal3.c process pid.
