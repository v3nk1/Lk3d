	See the "sigaction.png" pic in this directory and make sure that its a "union" so we can use only one of the member in this union first member is a fuction ptr which is behaves like as signal api..
	
	The 2nd member is sigacion member using this we can get more information of signal..(in this ptr to function the 2nd arg is siginfo_t)..
