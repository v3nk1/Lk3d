=>	In previous approach the data what we have dealt with is only of interger type.. 

=>	So here in this directory i'm making the data to users choice(ie., i'm making it as generic in nature):
		So the data could be an interger or 
					char 	 or
					double	 or
					float	 or
					userdefined data_type (structure);

=>	Here user shuld take lots of resposible, since developer doesnt know what type of data the end user going to store in the 	list. So the user must create his data by himself and pass its reference as an argument to the function, so that we can 	  manage like a list..
