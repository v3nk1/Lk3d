Process Address sapce 
---------------------
	When a request is given to execute the program, executable image part of disk will be copied to promary memory
	by loader.to a process when starts executions is called process address space.
	- Memory used by a program at runtime is called address space.

Automatic Memory Allocation
---------------------------
    	Automatic memory allocation happens when you declare an automatic variable, such as a function argument or a local variable. 
	The space for an automatic variable is allocated when the compound statement containing the declaration is entered, 
	and is freed when that compound statement is exited. 


Static Memory Allocation
------------------------
	The allocation of memory for the specific fixed purposes of a program in a predetermined fashion controlled by the compiler 
	is said to be static memory allocation.
	
	Variables whose size is known to compiler at compile time and lifetime of variable is defined by compiler, and
	program cannot have control over the lifetime. (all variables declared in program)

	Static allocation is what happens when you declare a static or global variable. Each static or global variable 
	defines one block of space, of a fixed size. The space is allocated once, when your program is started and remains through out
	program lifetime.

Dynamic Memory Allocation
-------------------------
	
	The allocation of memory during the running of a program and under the control of the program is said to be 
	dynamic memory allocation.
	
	Compiler at compile-time does not have any information about such memory. Its allocated by program as and when
	need, and can be deallocated as and when needed.

	Dynamic variables are those that can have the space allocated to them as needed at some point during the execution 
	of a program or procedure and that can also be disposed of and have their space given back to the system by the program.
