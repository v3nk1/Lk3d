	In this project 1MB of memory will be managed by me., and serve to the user as much he request.
And more over it's like buddy algorithm., ie.,

	Our library will maitain 'available' memory like as follows:(2^n formate)

	suppose 1MB of memory available:

	1024*1024 B = 1024 KB = 1MB

	2^0 = 1, Devide total 1MB each fragment having 1B each. So
		1B 2B 3B 4B .... 1024B(1K) 1025B .... 1024*1024B(1M)
	Its quite hard., So make an assumption that our functions will allocate mininimum of 1K and max of 1MB
