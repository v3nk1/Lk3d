make tool
---------

	1. make is a Unix tool to simplify building executables 
	   from many modules (multiple source files).
	
	2. Make is a utility that automatically builds executable programs 
	   from source code by reading files called Makefiles (user defined 	       script files) which specify how to derive the target.
	
	3. make will generate executables by compiling source files
	   depending on condition (time stamp)

	4. compiles only those source files whose last accessed time is
	   greater that the created time of executable file.
