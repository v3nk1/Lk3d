Dynamic Approch
---------------

	
 	 alloc_chrdev_region() - register a range of char device numbers
 	 @dev: output parameter for first assigned number
 	 @baseminor: first of the requested range of minor numbers
 	 @count: the number of minor numbers required
 	 @name: the name of the associated device or driver
 	
 	 Allocates a range of char device numbers.  The major number will be
 	 chosen dynamically, and returned (along with the first minor number)
 	 in @dev.  Returns zero or a negative error code.
 	
Major Number
------------
- VFS maintains a vector to store all registered character device objects.
- Char device vector is an array of pointers of type struct cdev and of length of 4096.
- Major number assigned to device file is the offset into this char device vector,
  where the corresponding device cdev object is stored.

Minor Number
------------
- When multiple instances of same devices are connected, a common driver is used to execute
  operations on any of the instance.
- Applications must shown each instance of the device using unique device node.
- All device nodes would be created with same major number, but each file carries a unique
  id called minor number.
- When app initiates the operation driver extracts the minor number of the file to decide the
  physical device on which the operation is to be run.
