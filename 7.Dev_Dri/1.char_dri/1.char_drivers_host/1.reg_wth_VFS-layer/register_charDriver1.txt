- Char drivers can also be registered using kernel helper function register_chrdev.

Device file management
----------------------
	- Files representing char drivers must be retained until drivers are active.

	- When driver is unregistered, device node representing the driver must be deleted to avoid accidental
	  execution of applications using device file and perform associated operations.

	- Drivers can be implemented to automate the procedure of creating and removing device files using hot-plug subsystem.

	- This mechanism ensures that a device file never exists without the corresponding driver in memory.

Automate the device node creation using hot-plug subsystem.
-----------------------------------------------------------
	
	Steps:
        	Register char driver with device tree.
        	unregister char driver with device tree.
	
	Hot-plug Subsystem

	-----------------

	- Hot-plug system is designed whose objective is to auto configure and enabling required software in response to hardware event.

	- Hot-plug sub-system consist of the following components

        	- Device Tree
        	- Kernel thread to maintains device tree.
        	- User space daemon


	Device Tree
	-----------

	- It is a global data structure maintained by kernel to keep track of device configuration details.

	- For each hardware physically connected device tree enumerates a structure to store configuration details.
	
	- As and when hardware is connected/disconnected device tree is updated by adding/removing relevant device objects.

	- Device information can be accessed form used mode through a virtual file system sysfs mounted on /sys.



	Kernel Thread
	-------------

	- Device tree is continuously monitored by a kernel thread which notifies used space demons
  	  as and when a change occurrences in device tree.

	User space daemon
	----------------

	- specific linux distribution can provide a user space application for receiving hot-plug events delivered by Kernel thread.
	  ( Most of Desktop Linux distribution use a software package called udev as default user daemon to handle hot-plug events)

	- udev package contains a set of scripts which receives the events, sort events, validate the event and execute the 
	  corresponding action.

	- udev can create a device file to represent the driver and also launch the application that use device file.


Registering a char driver using misc interface
----------------------------------------------

- Linux kernel provides a ready to use char driver interface layer that provides driver registration and device node management 
  facility called misc.
